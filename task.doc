Develop a tool / test that can add a #of new rows to SQL table according to data exits in the table and grown by ID and date while exists.
Details:
User Input:
1. SQL server authentication details.(Test should run from any machine, not just locally on SQL server)
2. Name of relevant DB and table
3. How many new  rows to add 
4. Which field to consider as “ID” (Default, all numeric fields)
5. Balk size
6. #Of iterations


Tool Main flow:
1. Connect to the specify SQL server table
2. Tool should generate new rows to the table:
a. #of rows – according to user input.
b. Any ID Fields – sequentially
c. DateTime – sequentially according to exists table, see below
d. Other – copied
Generating data in new rows:
1. “ID” of each new row will be sequentially according to latest row exists in DB
2. DateTime – will be sequentially according to latest row exists in DB
3. All other fields will be copy as follow:
a. Select random row in the table and start copy from this row for  XXX
rows
b. Balk size and number of iteration should be “User Input” (Default, select random row and copy all data in one iteration)  
Example:
Given table:

Row Number
Customer
Customer ID
Date
Comments 
1
Customer1
CustomerID1
Date1
Comment1
2
Customer2
CustomerID2
Date2
Comment2
3
Customer3
CustomerID3
Date3
Comment3
4
Customer4
CustomerID4
Date4
Comment4
5
Customer5
CustomerID5
Date5
Comment5


User Input – 
SQL Server, DB, Table
#of new rows - 3
ID – Customer ID
Balk Size – 1
#of Iteration - 3
Results:
Tool should connect to SQL server and find relevant table 
Select one row randomly from the table
Copy single row (Balk size) and add it to the end of the table
Verify Customer ID and Date are manipulate as needed
Repeat these steps for 3 time
Please note – 
 User can add up to 1M new rows so please take into consideration performance and efficient algorithm
